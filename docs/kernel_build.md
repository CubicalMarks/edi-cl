# Kernel Build Instructions

The kernel build gets done automatically by
[this workflow](https://github.com/lueschem/edi-ci-public/blob/main/.github/workflows/kernel-build-iot-gate-imx8.yml).

The instructions are derived from the
[Compulab setup](https://github.com/compulab-yokneam/meta-bsp-imx8mm/blob/iot-gate-imx8_r2.4/Documentation/linux_kernel_build.md)
and adapted so that a Debian package gets built.
